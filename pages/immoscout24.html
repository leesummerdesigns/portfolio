With the insights, we created 4 segments based on different criteria points, four interview partners per segment. Having these 2 main Personae we created 4 scenario personae that represented a different life path. The Investor, the long term saver, the young and hip entrepreneur, and the typical family father. We then created a high fidelity persona to be able to use it for customer journey analysis and different scenarios when creating the product.</p>

                <p class="cs-section-intro">After the extensive analysis, we wanted to create a process tailored to the user. This process had to be adapted to the customer's individual needs, be as fast as possible, and be easy for everyone to understand. To achieve this, before beginning the insertion we need to know the usertype, type of property and if he wants to sell or rent. In this way we are able to offer a experience that is adapted to the selections the user made..</p>

                <div class="cs-two-column">

                        <p>On the Insertion landing page the user would find different information regarding the insertion itself, but the only action to get started was the CTA that would lead the user inside the insertion process. However we wanted to use this area to find out who the user is, and what kind of property he want to advertise. For this we need 3 data points from the user</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Is he an owner, a professional or is he renting</li>
                            <li>2. Does he want to sell or rent out</li>
                            <li>3. The object type that he want to advertise</li>

                        </ul>

                <p>In the old version, our users complained about the perceived length of the insertion. The navigation shows users the remaining steps to publication, but each segment is on a different page, which caused users to lose track. We solved this problem by customizing the insertion to the needs of the ad, thus eliminating many unnecessary fields. To the left we placed a redesigned version of the navigation that allows users to keep track at all times, and the whole insertion process (except for payment) is on the same page.</p>

                        <p>The second big problem that many users complained about was that the price for the ad is displayed too late. Since Immoscout24 has different prices for different regions, we first do need the information about "postal code and city" after which an exact price for the 3 possible packages can be displayed.</p>
                        <p>We put the module with the location information at the beginning of the insertion to give our users the information about the price as soon as possible. After the user has entered his zip code, the price information appears directly underneath the field. We used this "input to reveal" method across the whole insertion not only to reduce the space of the modules, but also to engage users in interacting with the product.</p>

                <p>The product names of the bundles appear to be pretty outdated: we needed something more visually appealing for services (the bundled the features): but even the packages had no effect. Our solution to these components from the old packages to the smaller packages. We moved the small opt to the right now (to indicate user's start from left to right more often based on UX principles to start for the price has better results and can be more valuable.</p>
